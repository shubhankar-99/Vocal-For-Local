## Description
Vocal For Local - Talent Hunt will revolutionise the small business who can't get the limelight which they deserve despite working hard and giving their 100%. The vague trend which is going on in our society has to be removed i.e. instead of buing costly products from a supermarket . Why not buy something from the street Vendors??
"Rich are getting More Rich and Poor are getting More Poor" - This trend has to stop, otherwise we will reach a state where manking would be in grave danger.
Our Idea Through this WebApp is to Promote the local business instead of Big Businessmen. The main Goal is to change the trend of using big and expensive things as status Symbol.
#### For Eg -
If A person say Charlie Posts about A flower Vendor Harilal selling Flowers on street of Lucknow. Another Person can see By filtering the location Through our WebAPP and instead of going to A big Mall for buying same thing at a heavy price. This will give boost to Harilal .

In a big picture this Webapp will help boost our economy and more importantly will promote Make In India.
Another Bonus is the Like Feature which we have put in our WebApp. Any registered person can like any posts. This is going to help people choose the right people.
